        Q&A
  What’s so great about philosophy?
  Philosophy is something that we all have within in us. It’s the way we view the world and it’s what changes when we get a new perspective.

  What are your thoughts on post-modernism?
  My personality naturally tends to go against the flow of established ideas and methods. I think that post-modernism is a good thing and that we shouldn’t be scared of it.

      <h3>Axiology
        Axiology is the philosophical study of what is valued in society, whether it be the idea of why we regard intellect to a higher degree today than we did, say, 1000 years ago when strength was something that was seen higher on the hierarchy. Axiology is a useful area of study because society is always changing and adapting. As society shifts more towards a materialistic paradigm with AI on the rise, an interesting question to ask ourselves is, what might society value 100 years from now?
        
        Metaphysics
        Metaphysics, chances are that you deal with this study every day. When dealing with the concept of reality, we can all too easily fool ourselves into thinking that we are grounded and secured. But I have a question for you. What is stopping you from talking to your friend that you haven’t seen in years? Why do you feel social pressure when you talk in front of others? It’s because there is a metaphysical wall that is stopping you. A wall that, with the help of society, you have formed around yourself so that you wouldn’t stand out.
        
        Logic
        Logic is almost the reverse study of metaphysics. It is the study of what is there, what we know, how we reason, and what is tangible to us. The act of using logic usually is creating a connection between something that happens in the world and a conclusion of why it is.
        
        Aesthetic
        Aesthetics in philosophy is the study of beauty. We all see beauty around us in this world. What makes something beautiful to us? Where did we get this sense of beauty from? Seeing a view from up high, or admiring the cute qualities of our pets is all what we perceive as beauty.
        
        Epistemology
        Epistemology is the study of origin and the limits of human knowledge. Where are our roots from as humans who have developed society and rules to keep us organized.
        
        Ethics
        Another strong debate that is argued over today is what is ethical? When we create jail sentences, how do we know how much punishment is necessary? Or what about the death penalty? Is the death penalty cruel and unusual or is it an equal punishment to, lets say, murder? In the study of ethics, you will get to the source of what it means to be ethical.
        
        Political Philosophy
        Political philosophy is the study of how a government works and how it should be balanced over its people. This was a popular topic among famous philosophers including Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. There is still much room for advancement in this philosophical paradigm today as we struggle to find a correct way to run a country.
